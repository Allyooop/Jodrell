Jodrell CMS
=======

A Meteor CMS. A blueprint for a content management system built with Meteor that focuses on simplicity and gets out of the developers way

The aim is to create a simple site that people can clone and deploy and provide the basic functionality of a CMS so that those parts like creating a contact form, blog posts, user management, file uploads, inline content editing for users, partials, search and private resources (pages/uploads) are covered.

More of a boilerplate than a traditional CMS. Think an opinioned and battery-included starting point

In the end, this will turn into a series of APIs to control those features.
